## Proposal
Have you ever visited a website that gripped you? Regardless of product or purpose, certain web pages have an indellible impact on our online lives. Do you remember your first "Web 2.0" experience? Soft graphics, rounded corners. Do you remember Facebook's newsfeed? "How does it do that?" you may have asked. Ever heard of the "Pizza Tracker?" With this project I intend to evoke these sensations. 

Must take into account security features if I plan to go the finacial transaction route. I was thinking square integration should work for this. 

<strong>The subject:</strong> A cross platform reactive website to promote and sell my cousin's handmade aprons. 

<strong>The tech:</strong> Bleeding edge Vite + React tooling with Tailwind styling and Firebase BaaS.

<strong>The look:</strong> Minimal, modern, airy and bright.

This site will not only establish an online presence, but foster a new brand identity for the budding small business, Schurtzenliebe.

|  Meeting with client| 04/14/2023 | 10:00 AM - 11:32 AM | In person meeting with my cousin about her business and it's current online presence. Discussed creative vision behind her business and  how we can translate that into the site. Aquired photographs and logo for use on the page. Aquired an apron! for at home testing.| n/a | 1.5 | 
| Google maps integration | 04/21/2023  | 1:00PM - 3:00 PM | Studied google maps integration by mostly following the official google maps documentation. After difficulty in the past I decided to try the most basic integration, index.html, index.js and styles.css and work up from there. Went from this to webpack. Went from dynamic loading to using their nuget package. For something so ubiquitous it certainly isn't that easy. It might be good to have maps on the website to map retail locations that currently carry the product but we'll see.  | n/a | 3 |
