## Proposal
Have you ever visited a website that gripped you? Regardless of product or purpose, certain web pages have an indellible impact on our online lives. Do you remember your first "Web 2.0" experience? Soft graphics, rounded corners. Do you remember Facebook's newsfeed? "How does it do that?" you may have asked. Ever heard of the "Pizza Tracker?" With this project I intend to evoke these sensations. 

<strong>The subject:</strong> A cross platform reactive website to promote and sell my cousin's handmade aprons. 

<strong>The tech:</strong> Bleeding edge Vite + React tooling with Tailwind styling and Firebase BaaS.

<strong>The look:</strong> Minimal, modern, airy and bright.

This site will not only establish an online presence, but foster a new brand identity for the budding small business, Schurtzenliebe.
